		<h2>Why would I need to purchase new aglets?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>You need new aglets to make lacing shoes easier. A new set of aglets can really breath new life into an old worn out pair of laces.</p>
			<p>A new pair of aglets will also make you more attractive and get you a better job. Guaranteed.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Why are your aglets better than those from your competitors?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Because ours are made with love. And an environmentally friendly micropolyfibercarbonite.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Are your aglets available in different colors?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Yes. Though clear is our most popular color.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>What is the official definition of an aglet?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>According to Wikipedia (and if it's on Wikipedia, you know it's 100% correct) - <em>An aglet (or aiglet) is a small plastic or metal sheath typically used on each end of a shoelace, cord, or drawstring. An aglet keeps the fibers of the lace or cord from unraveling; its firmness and narrow profile make it easier to hold and easier to feed through the eyelets, lugs, or other lacing guides.</em></p>
